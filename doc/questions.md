# Questions and analysis
List of questions to address.

## 1. Aggregate-level analysis
These analyses will describe the current state of the Philadelphia bail system and address the question "who / what communities are heavily impacted by the bail system?"

- Q1.1 Aggregate information on bail
	* Total amount of bail set (per year?)
	* Total amount of bail posted (per year?)
	* Distribution of time (detained or not) between arrest and case outcome decided
	* Total days spent in jail (per year?) when bail not posted
	* Time series analysis of these statistics

- Q1.2 What is the race statistics of people impacted by bail? (wait for court summary to get race information) Related to Q2.2

- Q1.3 What is the financial stability of the neighborhoods highly impacted by bail? 
	* Use median hosuehold income of each zipcode to show that many people live in high poverty areas

## 2. Relationships between bail type / amount and various factors 
These analyses will address the question "what determines someone's bail type and bail amount?" 

- Q2.1 Relationship between bail type / amount and the following factors: 
	- age, zipcode, magistrate, whether they were represented by a private lawyer or a public defender, amount of time detained before prelim/bail hearing, time of hearing (Data available in csv).
	- race, gender, offense type (Data will be available soon from scraped dockets an court summaries).
	- amount of time (detained or not) between arrest and case outcome decided (Data may be available from old dockets)

- Q2.2 Relationship between defendant race and the following factors:
	* bail type / amount (Duplicate of question Q2.1)
	* amount of time detained before prelim/bail hearing
	* whether bail is posted
	* amount of time (detained or not) between arrest and case outcome decided (Data may be available from old dockets)
	* Race information will be availabe soon from scraped dockets and court summaries

- Q2.3 What are the strongest factors determining bail type / bail amount? 
	* do a predictive modeling (regression, decision tress, random forest, etc) & feature importance type analysis
	* wait until we get the race, gender, and offense type information.

- Q2.4 Relationship between outcomes (conviction, sentencing) and bail type, bail amount, and whether bail is posted (Data may be available from old dockets) 


## 3. Other questions
- Does bail actually lead to better presence at trials? This analysis could be used to support the end of the bail system
	* check if docket event list indicates whether trial rescheduling is a result of defendant failing to appear
