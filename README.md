# pbf-analysis
Stored repo of analysis project for the Philly Bail Fund


Repository containing code built for analyzing data associated with Bail hearings and process in Philadelphia, in partnership with the [Philadelphia Bail Fund](https://www.phillybailfund.org/).  The goal of this project is to provide PBF with flexible tools for analyzing their efforts, the general bail system in Philadelphia, and potential findings that could influence decision makers.
